Hello,

this is my first 32- Bit "Mini Project" with C++ and SDL2 (in Visual Studio 2019). Therefore I kept it simple.
There are 5 Level to play, after that the Game will end, but you can restart it if you wish.
The EXECUTEBLE File for everyone (if you donÂ´t have Visual Studio) can be found in the "Debung" folder.
Have fun!

BUGS: sometimes the sound doesn't play if you hit a bit late so please don't worry !

This Project is free for everyone, but WITHOUT ANY liability or guarantee / warranty!

pronunciation: Catch-it (it means catching the falling objects, has NOTHING to do with the PANDEMIC !!!!)
